# Ember.js Interactive Interview

We'll be adding a feature to an EmberJS implementation of the classic [ToDoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).

Although this interview is technical in nature (requiring JavaScript expertise, commandline familiarity,
code reading, and debugging), it is more importantly a chance to see how you think and work with others.

## Preparation

1. Ensure you have node installed on your development machine
2. Clone this repo and run the following in the root of the project
3. `npm install`
4. `ember serve`
5. You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:4200

This project is built in Ember 2.x with Ember 2.x dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

**If `ember serve` doesn't work**
Try installing EmberCLI globally with `npm install -g ember-cli@2.18`
